# Breast-Ultrasound-Image-Segmentation-DeepLabV3+

This repository contains the implementation for deep lab V3 model, trained on the breast ultrasound image segmentation data set. There is a interactive Jupiter Notebook file in the directory.
This is exactly the same file present in my Kaggle account for Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation using DeepLabV3+.
